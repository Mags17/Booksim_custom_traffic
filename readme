"Booksim_qt_analytic_compare"

This is a modified BookSim 2.0 simulator which accepts application specific traffic.
An external program "pgm_within_pgm" calls this programm but it can be used standalone also
It reads one mapping and injection rate from the mapping file and generates the avg packet latency and 
writes in output file.
The mapping number to be read is decided by the arguement which is passed to the program while calling it by
an external program "pgm_within_pgm"
