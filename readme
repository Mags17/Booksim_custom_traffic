"Booksim_qt_analytic_compare"

This is a booksim simulator compiled in QTcreator.
An external program "pgm_within_pgm" calls this programm but it can be used standalone also
It reads one mapping and injection rate from the mapping file and generated the avg packet latency and 
writes in output file.
The mapping number to be read is decided by the arguement which is passed to the program while calling it by
an external program "pgm_within_pgm"
